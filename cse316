1 .PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Ten students (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j) are going to get there pictured clicked by university camera. Only one student can enter the camera room while the other students wait outside the room. The students are waiting in a queue to enter the room. To pass time the students start to play a game. In this game the students give candies to each other in a random manner (assume the students never run out of candies). They decide that the student with highest candies will be allowed to enter. When the student with highest amount of candies enter the room, the student starts the game again. Initially the students do not know if there is any body in the room and they start their game and the student with highest candies enter. Write and implement the algorithm to schedule such and compute the waiting and turnaround time. Consider the arrival time and burst time as given by the user.
		
2. ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT (DESCRIPTION):
Given that there are 10 subjects waiting in a queue waiting for their turn to get their job done. Where along with a game is played among them which reinitialize their sequence of their queue according to the one who wins the game.

If the above scenario is viewed in terms of the operating systems, the below conclusions can be drawn.
•	There are 10 processes in the ready queue. 
•	Once the Photoshop room is nothing but the CPU. 
•	The game they played results in prioritizing the processes.
•	With respect to that of the priority the process (student) will be allowed to use the resourceses of CPU(allowed to enter the room).
